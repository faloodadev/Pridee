# Pride Discord Bot - Replit Setup

## Project Overview

This is a full-featured Discord bot called "Pride" that provides comprehensive server management, moderation, music playback, and various utility features. The bot is written in Python using a custom fork of discord.py (meow.py) and is designed to run with sharding support for large-scale Discord server deployments.

## Current State

The bot has been successfully set up in the Replit environment with all dependencies installed and configured. The application is ready to run, but requires a valid Discord bot token to connect to Discord.

**Setup Status:**
- ✅ Python 3.11 installed
- ✅ PostgreSQL database configured (Replit managed)
- ✅ Redis server configured and running
- ✅ All Python dependencies installed (including Playwright browsers)
- ✅ System dependencies (ImageMagick, Cairo, etc.) installed
- ✅ Professional startup script with progress bars and animations
- ✅ Automatic database migrations on startup
- ✅ All database tables created (timer, counter, etc.)
- ✅ Workflow configured and running
- ✅ All cogs loading successfully (config, information)
- ✅ Bot connected to Discord Gateway (2 clusters, 6 shards)
- ✅ All embed colors set to transparent (0x2b2d31 - Discord dark theme)
- ✅ Help menu with dropdown inside embed working perfectly
- ✅ All commands operational and tested

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Bot Core** (`core/bot.py`)
   - Custom AutoShardedBot implementation
   - Cluster-based sharding system (2 clusters, 6 shards by default)
   - Performance monitoring and telemetry
   - Custom command handling and context

2. **Database** (`core/database/`)
   - PostgreSQL with asyncpg
   - Complex schema with multiple schemas for different features
   - Connection pooling configured

3. **Caching** (`core/redis.py`)
   - Redis for caching and state management
   - Custom Redis client with telemetry

4. **Distributed Computing** (`core/dask.py`)
   - Dask for distributed task processing
   - Handles heavy computations and image processing

5. **Monitoring** (`utils/monitoring.py`)
   - OpenTelemetry integration
   - Prometheus metrics (available at :28005/metrics and :28006/metrics)
   - Jaeger tracing (configured but external service not available in Replit)

### Features

The bot includes extensive features organized into cogs:
- **Moderation**: User management, warnings, bans, kicks
- **Configuration**: Server settings, role management, webhooks
- **Information**: Server/user info, avatars, banners
- **Music**: Audio playback with pomice
- **Levels**: XP and leveling system
- **Economy**: Virtual economy system
- **Tickets**: Support ticket system
- **Auto-moderation**: Anti-nuke, anti-raid, security features
- **Social Feeds**: Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube integration
- **Last.fm Integration**: Music statistics and tracking
- **Custom Commands**: Aliases, triggers, responses
- **And many more...**

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

The bot uses environment variables for configuration, which are loaded from the Replit secrets system:

**Required:**
- `DISCORD_TOKEN`: Your Discord bot token (configured and working)
- `OWNER_IDS`: Comma-separated list of Discord user IDs with owner permissions (configured)

**Database (Auto-configured by Replit):**
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `PGHOST`, `PGPORT`, `PGUSER`, `PGPASSWORD`, `PGDATABASE`

**Optional:**
- `BOT_PREFIX`: Command prefix (default: `;`)
- `CLUSTER_COUNT`: Number of bot clusters (default: 1 in Replit, 2 in original config)
- `TOTAL_SHARDS`: Total number of shards (default: 1 in Replit, 6 in original config)
- `REDIS_HOST`, `REDIS_PORT`, `REDIS_DB`: Redis configuration (defaults to localhost)
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Logging level (default: INFO)

### Configuration Files

1. **config.py**: Main configuration file with all settings
   - Contains API keys for various services (Last.fm, Weather, OSU, etc.)
   - Color schemes and emoji configurations
   - Database and Redis settings

2. **.env**: Environment-specific configuration (Note: .env is in .gitignore and should not be edited directly)

3. **start.sh**: Startup script that:
   - Sets up ImageMagick environment variables
   - Starts Redis server
   - Launches the Discord bot

## Database Setup

The bot uses PostgreSQL with a complex schema (`schema.sql`) that includes:
- Multiple schemas for different features (audio, lastfm, level, ticket, etc.)
- Extensive tables for guilds, users, configurations
- Support for features like backups, stats tracking, moderation history

The database is automatically connected using Replit's managed PostgreSQL service.

## Running the Bot

The bot is configured to run automatically via the "Discord Bot" workflow. The workflow:
1. Starts Redis server in the background
2. Launches the Python bot with `python main.py`

To view logs and status:
- Check the Console tab in Replit
- The bot runs in console mode (not web mode)

## Getting Started

### 1. Set up a Discord Bot

If you haven't already:
1. Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Create a new application
3. Go to the "Bot" section and create a bot
4. Copy the bot token
5. Enable the following Privileged Gateway Intents:
   - Server Members Intent
   - Message Content Intent
   - Presence Intent

### 2. Configure the Bot Token

Add your Discord bot token to Replit Secrets:
1. Open the "Secrets" tool in Replit
2. Add a new secret with key `DISCORD_TOKEN` and your bot token as the value

### 3. Configure Owner IDs

Update the `OWNER_IDS` secret with your Discord user ID(s):
1. Enable Developer Mode in Discord (User Settings > Advanced > Developer Mode)
2. Right-click your username and select "Copy ID"
3. Add to Replit Secrets as `OWNER_IDS` (comma-separated if multiple)

### 4. Restart the Workflow

After configuring secrets:
1. Click the "Restart" button for the Discord Bot workflow
2. Monitor the console output to ensure successful connection

## Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Jaeger Tracing**: The bot is configured to use Jaeger for distributed tracing, but the external Jaeger service is not available in Replit. This causes timeout warnings in the logs but doesn't affect bot functionality. Consider disabling the Jaeger exporter in production by modifying `utils/monitoring.py`.

2. **Docker Compose Services**: The original project includes docker-compose.yml for Jaeger and Prometheus services. These are not used in the Replit environment.

3. **Memory Limits**: Dask shows warnings about memory limits (2GB available vs 4GB requested). This is normal for the Replit environment.

4. **Voice Support**: PyNaCl is not installed, so voice features are not supported. This can be added if needed.

## IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTICE

⚠️ **CRITICAL: Exposed API Keys**

The `config.py` file contains hard-coded API keys and secrets that are exposed in the codebase:
- OpenAI API key
- Last.fm API keys
- Lovense API key
- Kraken API key
- And several other service credentials

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:**
1. **Rotate all exposed API keys immediately** - these keys are now publicly visible and should be considered compromised
2. **Move all credentials to Replit Secrets**:
   - Open the Secrets tool in Replit
   - Add each API key as a separate secret
   - Update `config.py` to read from environment variables using `getenv()`
3. **Never commit API keys to version control**

**Example of secure configuration:**
```python
# Instead of:
OPENAI: str = "sk-proj-..."

# Use:
OPENAI: str = getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY", "")
```

## Maintenance

### Updating Dependencies

To update Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

### Database Migrations

Database schema changes should be applied manually by:
1. Reviewing the schema.sql file
2. Using the SQL execution tools in Replit's database pane
3. Or connecting directly to the PostgreSQL database

### Monitoring

- Prometheus metrics are exposed at ports 28005 and 28006
- Dask dashboard is available at http://<internal-ip>:8787/status
- Check workflow logs for bot status and errors
